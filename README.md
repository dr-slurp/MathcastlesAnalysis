# MathcastlesAnalysis

First commit of a testbed to analyze the math castles metadata. 

New features:

    parsing the JSON dump into the Mathcastle java object
    
    indexing the Mathcastle objects into a coordinate map, which allows you to find any math castle by level, x coordinate, and y coordinate

Planned features:

    finding all empty coordinates
    
    finding all corner plots
    
    building tools to answer your math castle questions


big thanks to uronsol for providing the JSON dump of the metadata. See https://github.com/uronsol/terraforms-full-metadata
